# Console 3D Cube Renderer

A simple yet impressive 3D rotating cube rendered in the Windows console using ASCII art. This project demonstrates basic 3D graphics concepts like perspective projection, lighting (ambient + diffuse), Z-buffering for occlusion, and face culling, all without external libraries. It runs smoothly at ~60 FPS and adapts to console resizing.

The cube features colored faces for better contrast, improved occlusion to prevent blending at edges/corners, and interactive controls for scale and rotation speed.
